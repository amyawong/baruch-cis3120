    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n",
    "This is a very unique fish market as it only sells 4 types of fish.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- salmon: sells for 7.50 per pound  \n",

    "Your program will start by prompting the cashier to enter the quantity of each type of fish purchased. That is, there will be 4 prompts. For example, \"enter the quantity (lbs) of salmon\n",
    "purchased, enter the quantity (lbs) of trout purchased, \" etc...   \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n",
    "The program will then calculate the subtotals for each type of fish purchased and then the final overall total.  \n",

    "If the customer buys 10lbs of trout and 15 lbs of salmon, then apply a 25% discount to the overall bill.  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n",
    "If the customer buys 20lbs of cod or 45 lbs of flounder, then apply a 20% discount to the overall bill (in addition to any other discounts already applied). That is, it is possible for a customer to receive 45% off of the overall bill.\n",
